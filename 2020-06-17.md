-   Standing items

    -   **Introductions**: new joinees should feel welcome to introduce
        > themselves and their interest in zarr/n5.

    -   Lauren: Unidata intern. NetCDF Fortran/Zarr/Matlab. Atmospheric
        > science background. Upcoming PhD in Ocean Science at Duke.

-   As time permits

    -   Josh: Conventions/examples around of storing
        > [*geojson*](https://geojson.org) within .zattrs?

        -   V3 spec , .zattrs will be part of .zgroup/.zarray so far.

            -   [*Should we stick with that, or consider
                > changing*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/72)?

        -   Geojson is a spec for defining shapes. Embed geojson into a
            zarr file? Anyone has tried that?

        -   E.g., if there are shapes of interest within an image

        -   Matthias: note the spec issue for joining zattrs and zgroup.
            Probably need to nudge people for strong views.

        -   Josh: *if* something like geojson is used, then the
            attributes could become large.

        -   Alistair: one benefit of a single file is having a single
            request on group/array creation. (Downside is one has to
            pull everything down.)

        -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/72*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/72)
            should be raised at an upcoming spec meeting.

        -   What's the worst? Movie, many cells in each frame, draw
            around each of those.

        -   Matthias: does the protocol allow storing json in files
            other than .zattrs?

        -   Josh: Not yet, but Dennis has suggested it.

        -   Alistair: protocol only restricts some (object
            storage)-keys, others can be written.

        -   Matthias: but the others aren’t *reachable*.

        -   Josh: non-listing use case. I.e. good to have all obj-keys
            “registered”

        -   Alistair: have suggested to others to use the zattrs
            mechanism rather than new keys. (Not explicitly documented)

        -   John: graduating .zgroup and .zattrs to directories with
            many json blobs.

        -   Dennis: won’t help with the non-listing use case.

        -   Matthias: unless you know the keys

        -   Josh: could imagine registering new extensions (.geojson) in
            the .zgroup metadata for discoverability

        -   Matthias: Locking?

        -   Dennis: if you can’t search, then zgroups needs to list the
            subgroups (also subject to locking issue)

        -   Alistair: situations where the store isn’t listable could be
            solved by some form of consolidation. Primary thing we want
            to support is that when you are creating arrays, that can be
            in parallel.

        -   Alistair: user-driven process of choosing to use
            consolidated (if it even exists … Matthias: and is
            up-to-date?!)

        -   Consolidated metadata in an extension.

        -   Alistair: might build an hierarchy over *days*.

        -   Matthias: cf. PNG that isn’t valid until its written.

        -   Dennis: thinking we need to have at least gross level of
            file locking.

        -   Alistair: typically create hierarchy in parallel, and when
            they are done, consolidate.

        -   Dennis/Josh: period where consolidated metadata could be
            invalid in the file system store

        -   Martin: for S3 everyone will see things at a different time.

            -   *Potentially* could require versions (all the same,
                > etc.) at a cost.

        -   John: consolidated metadata came from wanting multiple keys
            in one request. If we’re using parallel get then perhaps
            it’s no longer relevant.

        -   Matthias: other problem is listing stores. Should we
            disallow a non-listing store? Implementation of the store.
            Then can make zattrs a directory to get parallel write.

        -   Alistair: multiple intersecting use cases:

            -   What to do if not listable?

            -   Xarray use-case of retrieving all metadata all arrays in
                > a group upfront (original motivation for consolidated.
                > Latency was the issue)

            -   Eventual-consistency compatibility

            -   Use case, supporting concurrent array creation

            -   Use case, supporting concurrent writes into different
                > regions of the same array

    -   Josh: Anyone know (and trust) a generic zarr ←→ HDF5 converter?

        -   Alistair: in zarr-python there is a function to copy groups
        -   Zarr-python
            [*copy*](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/convenience.html#zarr.convenience.copy)
        -   [*https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/convenience.html#zarr.convenience.copy*](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/convenience.html#zarr.convenience.copy)
        -   Josh: thanks all. Perhaps what I’m thinking of would be a
            h5py version of **zarr.convenience.copy_store**. Any
            interest?

    -   Josh: Would there be any support behind unifying the API
        > terminology for arrays? cf create_dataset …

        -   Matthias note: the will be an effort in Open Team to have
            “PyData API” workgroup. Maybe that fits in there.
        -   Alistair: modelled on numpy, but also wanted h5py
            compatibility. Good thing to try to unify (across PyData)

    -   Matthias : did anyone seen tiledb ?
        > ([*https://tiledb.com/*](https://tiledb.com/))

        -   Alistair: solving a similar problem as zarr. E.g. two
            writers writing different regions of an array could come
            into contention, possibly leading to data loss. Zarr-python
            has 2 ways of working around this: (1) organize writes so
            that they are aligned with chunk boundaries or (2) use a
            chunk-level locking mechanism. Tildb solves that in a
            different way without locking: files that get stored don’t
            correspond to chunks, but the write operations
            (time-stamped) and an index keeps track of them. Can
            reconstruct any point of time and don’t need to worry about
            chunk boundaries. Also has a background process to
            re-organize files. But less hackability.

        -   Some discussion with TileDB authors in this issue:
            [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/515*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/515)

        -   Alistair: Google recently released tensorstore on GCFS which
            has another feature: locking with eventual consistency. Each
            object has a generation number, incremented on each update.
            “Only write if my write is the next write in the sequence”,
            i.e. OptimisticLocking. Matthias: and neighboring chunks?
            Read all, then write all conditionally … Martin: but could
            get inconsistent … i.e. need transactions. Alistair: would
            be interesting to engineer that into the spec so that you
            think about writes as a retriable event. (Note: conditional
            writes are separate from versioning) Martin: potentially
            batch operations

        -   John: recently saw something similar with
            timestamped-directories for the chunks. Should be able to
            perform unique writes. Bake it into the spec. \[Listable as
            a special edge case….\]

    -   Matthias : Re, Partial Read.

        -   Progressive loading (e.g. of an image). FFT low frequency
            gets loaded first. Related to decompressors with partial
            decompression. Ask blosc for new API to make use of a store
            that could seek.

        -   Alistair: that’s one path, multi-step “which bytes? Here are
            the bytes” Seems complex. Impacts on codec and store API.

            -   Trying to speed things up, but without loading too much
                > data

            -   Other path is storing things differently, different bits
                > as an object.

        -   Matt: differences between ML & image use case

        -   Alistair: shuffle operation is big

    -   Matthias : Python Json does not always respect JSON “standard”.

        -   Especially around Nan and Inf. Need to be careful for other
            languages.
