# 4th November, 2020

Notes, with Daylight saving time ending it might be unclear at what time
this meeting is.

**Attending**: Ryan Williams, Mathias Bussonnier, Eric Perlman, Martin
Durant, Josh Moore, John Kirkham

"Waiting for the host to start this meeting"… I think it's Josh's zoom
right?

I'll make a Zoom in the meantime:
[*https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86935712322*](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86935712322?pwd=YlNmRW1JTFVKd3JuRlhqMWEram9OQT09)

It requests a password:

Josh: Sorry, I thought we had another 45 minutes. Am currently “at”

Discussing
[*\#645*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/645);
Martin to have a look.

[*FAQ*](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/migrate/open-source-repository-migration#frequently-asked-questions);
TravisCI to give one-off 1000mins to OSS on 1/1/21? won't last long

-   GH actions has macOS; unsure how to spin up Docker multiple docker
    services (e.g. redis) in GH actions?

    -   in travis we use \`sudo: true\` and run services outside docker

-   unsure where else we can test on macOS; [*CircleCI seems to support
    it*](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/hello-world-macos/) (for $$).

-   thinking we can negotiate something w/ TravisCI

-   Azure has {macOS,Linux/Windows}.

-   Could put some things on GHA, leave some on Travis

**new fsspec feature** (unreleased): map specific remote byte ranges to
local path? cf.
[*zarr-python#556*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/556),
[*intake/filesystem_spec#464*](https://github.com/intake/filesystem_spec/pull/464),
[*HDF5-walking
gist*](https://gist.github.com/ajelenak/80354a95b449cedea5cca508004f97a9)

-   in principle, could also use this to virtually concatenate
    byte-ranges from multiple remote files into one "local" file
-   Eric Perlman: scale to millions or billions? Probably not, but could
    use a generator approach.
-   Neuroglancer:
    [*https://github.com/google/neuroglancer*](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer)
-   Also sped up by the new async work.
-   Trevero Manz (or colleague)’s tiff-tiler (offsets from OME-TIFF):
    https://github.com/hms-dbmi/ome-tiff-tiler/blob/master/context/ometiff_tiler.py

Lots of open PRs need review on zarr-{python,specs}.
