-   Xarray/NetCDF (Josh)

    -   Trying to get everyone at a (virtual) table

    -   Ward happy to be involved

    -   Dennis nczarr already supports xarray-convention

    -   Josh: development of https://github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree
        > may suggest more conversations around this

-   Multiscale representation? (Jeremy)

    -   any relationship between the dimensions? No. Not yet.

    -   Typically done at a higher level (like cfconventions)

-   Updates from Sanket

        > \[[*link*](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/release.html#release-2-11-1)\]

        -   outstanding 2.11 issue:
            [*965*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/965)

    -   Thoughts on changing the default branch?
        > \[[*issue*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/governance/issues/15)\]

        -   Jeremy: code doesn't look dangerous. Josh: agreed, more a
            question

        -   Jeremy: another option would be branching by configuration.

        -   **Isaac: status page for v3 on what’s being developed would
            be useful**

        -   **Greg: consensus on file-ending? .zr3?**

            -   Jeremy: could see some benefit for inspecting paths
                > .zr3/path/to/array

    -   GSoC 2022
        > \[[*link*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/gsoc/blob/main/2022/ideas-list.md)\]

        -   Awkward Arrays
        -   Isaac: all of AA or ragged arrays / vlen? TBD
        -   Dennis: another thing that’s not in the specification
        -   [*https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/v2.11.1/tutorial.html#ragged-arrays*](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/v2.11.1/tutorial.html#ragged-arrays)
        -   Josh: all agreed. Having a v3 to cover the ragged arrays
            would be a great outcome
        -   Jeremy: only on a chunk? (since a codec)
        -   comparison to HDF5

    -   Cloud Native Outreach Day: CFP Deadline 15th March
