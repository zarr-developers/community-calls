# 2024-05-15

**Attending:** Davis Bennett (DB), Sanket Verma (SV), Dennis Heimbigner (DH), Brianna PagƒÅn (BP), Thomas Nicholas (TN), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS)

## TL;DR:

The team discussed the new Zarr-Python 2.18.0 release, ongoing work on validators, and the potential integration of VirtualiZarr into zarr-developers. They also explored the challenges and future directions for supporting V2 and V3 implementations, codecs, and storage transformers.

**Updates:**

- Zarr-Python 2.18.0 out now: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/releases/tag/v2.18.0>
    - One of the last few releases for Zarr Spec 2 - if there's anything you want to get in, please reply/tag us in the PRs/issues
- New blog post by Joe Hamman: <https://zarr.dev/blog/zarr-python-v3-update/>
- Zarr-Python developers meeting new schedule - check here: <https://zarr.dev/community-calls/>
- Lachlan Deakin added support for sharding in his R implementation: <https://github.com/LDeakin/zarrs/releases/tag/v0.13.1>

**Meeting Minutes:**

- SV: How's the implementation coming up?
    - DH: ArraytoArray codecs is still needs to go there
    - DB: Are you trying to support implicit groups?
    - DH: Trying to add it
    - DB: We're trying to remove it
    - DH: Focusing on adding support for V2 and V3
    - DB: Poses a bit of problem than making things easier
- Zarr Validators - tool to check if the Zarr data conforms to the specification or not
    - Similar to OME-NGFF Validators: <https://ome.github.io/ome-ngff-validator/?source=https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk/idr/zarr/v0.4/idr0062A/6001240.zarr>
    - Brianna for geozarr: <https://github.com/briannapagan/geozarr-validator/> need to update and will abstract, but realization that most of this is just zarr data model validating as-is with a few lines of geozarr specific checks. 
    - BP: Work on GeoZarr spec continues - roadblocked by cf conventions - how much we want to utilise it - parallely working on creating a validator - don't want to replicate the cf conventions
    - DB: [Pydantic-Zarr](https://github.com/janelia-cellmap/pydantic-zarr/) has a validator - you can give a hierarchy and it validates it - 
    - DB: <https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/pydantic-ome-ngff>
    - BP: Thanks for sharing it - we'll try to adapt from Pydantic-Zarr
    - DB: <https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/ztree> is an outdated implementation of Pydantic-Zarr
    - BP: Difference b/w ZOM and Pydantic-Zar?
    - DB: Spec doesn't define hierarchies - and folks care about groups - storing the hierarchy structures in form of `JSON` document
    - DB: Having ZOM ZEP implementation in initial V3 release would help with the tests a lot
    - TN: ZOM ZEP can be useful for VirtualiZarr
- Codecov not reports lagging in recent PRs - any ideas how to fix it?
    - DB: Maybe because of fixtures and long list of files
    - DB: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1813>
- TN: Interested in having VirtualiZarr under zarr-developers!
    - DB: Sounds good!
    - SV: We can transfer the repo to zarr-developers and provide TN required privleges
- TN: Storage transformers discussion
    - DH: _recap of the past discussion would be appreciated_
    - TN: _starts recapping_
    - DH: Can this be handled by codecs in V3? - you already have ArraytoArray, ArraytoBytes, BytestoBytes...
    - JMS: It could be! - would be a interesting to see
    - DH: Maybe a experimentation first would be a good idea?
    - DB: Using codec might not be desirable if you want to change the data 
    - DH: Codec would only to take care of the existing dimensions and nothing else
    - JMS: ArraytoByte covers endian
    - DH: Perhaps the virtual concept of storage transformers can be defined as a codec
    - DB: V2 codecs don't know anything about the storage - only converting bytes to nd-array and vice versa
    - DH: But in V3 the concept of codecs has been expanded
    - DH: Shards cannot be moved around or compressed because the sharding codecs doesn't have a mechanism to track the shards - needs to be looked at
    - TN: All of the manifests of array, metadata, groups are combined when you use Kerchunk but VirtualiZarr separates it and makes it easier for various tasks like concatenation
