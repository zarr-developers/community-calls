    -   John: protocol extension to treat files as 1-D, uint8

        -   in v2, .zattrs? as a single chunk….

    HOORRAY!

-   Ryan: reporting discussion for the end of the month.

    -   Greg: what needs doing on the zarr_implementation side?

    -   Josh: largely showing v3 spec, and python done

    -   Hailey: Java implementation **won’t** be v3 on that time scale

-   John: nvidia work on GPU support in Zarr (\~Sep. 2019)

    -   will be resurrected. 0.5-1 day / week to get that in.

    -   allows loading cupy arrays in python (also contrib. to cupy)

    -   Josh: sounds related to EOSS4

    -   John: hopefully it can handle other types of arrays (sparse,
        > etc.)

    -   Some numcodecs PRs may need to get in.
