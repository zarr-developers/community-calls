Attendees: Josh, Ward, Jackson, Hailey, Dennis, John

-   Introductions

-   Community items?

    -   Papers & benchmarks (aicsimageio!)

    -   OME meeting: “did you think of zarr”

    -   Messaging (and all the papers). EOSS money?

    -   Conferences in the Winter season: [*AGU*](https://www.agu.org),
        > [*EGU*](https://www.egu.eu), …

        -   Talking about NetCDF & Zarr. Good chance to coordinate.
        -   Very large, 25K attendees! “Earth science” incl. a
            lifescience component
        -   Ward to bring it back to our attention when proposals are
            open.
        -   “Earth and space science informatics” section. Daily
            posters.
        -   “Technologies as they apply to a domain” (10+5)
        -   Also cross-discipline sessions.

-   Core

    -   Josh (Py): Dependabot & Python 3.6

        -   John: dropped in xarray, dask, tifffile, numpy
        -   Josh to open an issue
        -   https://github.com/zarr-developers/governance/issues/11
        -   https://github.com/zarr-developers/community/issues

    -   Josh (Py): Review backlog

        -   e.g. Azure
        -   “Mutable mapping from all cloud providers” ❤️
        -   Use of owners?
        -   [*https://github.blog/2017-07-06-introducing-code-owners/*](https://github.blog/2017-07-06-introducing-code-owners/)
        -   via blame … separate files.
        -   [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/759*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/759)
            → storage into a package and then separate files.
        -   Start with an issue? →

    -   Dennis (C)

        -   How proposing to handle numcodec in nczarr.
            [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/41#issue
            comment-848222877*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/41#issuecomment-848222877)

        -   Also how to store structs?
            [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/118*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/118)

            -   [*https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/pull/73#issuecomment-688731487*](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/pull/73#issuecomment-688731487)

            -   Dennis: in HDF5 you can specify the padding. In python
                > is all tightly packed? (Would prefer to stick with
                > tightly packed)

            -   John:
                > [*https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html#automatic-byte-offsets-and-alignment*](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html#automatic-byte-offsets-and-alignment)
                > is the definition. Possibly configurable. Would need
                > input to know what is important.

        -   Primarily working on filters for netcdf

        -   Exposing numcodec API through netcdf (i.e. specifying filter
            through JSON). Not supported at the moment. Need to use HDF5
            mechanism.

            -   John: support for categories (e.g. enums) that e an ID.

            -   Dennis: use characters (enums) for it.

            -   John: testing of various implementations in
                > [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr_implementations/tree/master/generate_data*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr_implementations/tree/master/generate_data)

        -   Critical to get users is the interoperability with HDF5. A
            bit stuck.

        -   **Even more important is xarray/zarr format.** (More people
            are using it)

        -   Need maximal interoperability with V2. V3 is on the horizon.
            (Won’t be there for quite a while)

        -   True for Java as well. Will be reading V2 for quite a while.

    -   Hailey (Java)

        -   Agreed. Need v2.
        -   Josh: update the spec & get zarr_implementations
        -   Dennis: live without structs. filters is important.
        -   Josh: so hearing that numcodecs registry is most important?
            [*https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/issues/278*](https://github.com/zarr-developers/numcodecs/issues/278)
        -   Dennis: most critical piece is officially change numcodec
            representation to optionally include HDF5 ID. → alias field.

-   Misc

    -   Josh: h5coro (for Martin) - tabled
